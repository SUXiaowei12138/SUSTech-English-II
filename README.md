 This is some resource that might be benifitial for you to learn this class.

 You can switch to branch 'vocab_sublists' to get the words in each vocab sublist via the individual PDFs.This will be a fast way for you to review the words before the quizzes or just to learn the words more efficiently after the exercise.

You can switch to branch 'Highlights' to aftertaste the amazing raps that Paul showed in the class.
